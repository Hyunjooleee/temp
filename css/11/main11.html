            Every great mistake has a halfway moment, a split second when it can be recalled and perhaps remedied.

            Every great mistake has a halfway moment, a split second when it can be recalled and perhaps remedied. 
            True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings; Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.
