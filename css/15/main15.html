                <p>Every serious-minded person knows that a large part of the effort required in moral discipline 
                    consists in the courage needed to acknowledge the unpleasant consequences of one's past and present acts.No matter how hard you work for success if your thought is saturated with the fear of failure, it will kill your efforts, 
                    neutralize your endeavors and make success impossible. Every great mistake has a halfway moment, a split second when it can be recalled and perhaps remedied.

                    We will not learn how to live together in peace by killing each other's children. It is not worth an 
                    intelligent man's time to be in the majority. By definition, there are already enough people to do that. 
                    Grief is the agony of an instant, the indulgence of grief the blunder of a life.</p>
